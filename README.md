# guessingGame
A simple console-based guessing game built with .NET 8. The application challenges the user to guess a hidden number between 1 and 100, providing feedback on each guess and tracking guess history with timestamps. This project emphasizes the use of basic programming concepts such as classes, lists, and conditional logic.
